Removing repeated elements from an array
Program to identify and remove all repeated elements from an array. Arrays could be of various types like integer, character or string.
10. Printing patterns
Program to print a given pattern composed of ASCII characters. The solution is required to employ an effective algorithm, as opposed to directly printing the pattern as it is.
11. Printing repetitive characters in a string
Program to identify and print all repeated characters of a string.
12. Finding the greatest common denominator of two numbers
Program to print the greatest common denominator of any two given numbers.
13. Finding the square root of a number
Program to print a given number's square root without employing the math.sqrt() function.
14. Reversing an array in place
Program to reverse the order of elements in a string, integer or character array.
15. Reversing the order of words in a sentence
Program to reverse the order of words in any given sentence.
16. Determining leap year
Program to determine whether a given year is a leap year or not.
17. Performing binary search
Program to perform binary search for a given character/integer within a sorted array. In a binary search, the search interval is repeatedly divided into half with every iteration.
18. Checking for anagrams
Program to check if two given strings are anagrams. An anagram is of the same length and is composed of the same characters, but in a different order.
19. Designing a vending machine
Program to create a vending machine interface based on a given set of guidelines. This is a popular OOAD (Object-Oriented Analysis and Design) problem that is frequently asked in Java interviews.
20. Reversing a number
Program to print any given number with the digits in reverse order.
